**Actual Measurement Results of HR-DCIM Silicon Verification**
</div>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; This document provides the measured results of HR-DCIM silicon verification. The measurement report includes three parts: 1) Chip Micrograph and Summary of Silicon Verification; 2) Test Platform Setup for Silicon Verification; 3) Measurement Results of Silicon Verification. Key measured metrics include: **area/energy efficiency, accuracy, cell error distribution, bit error rate (BER), and iteration latency.** Compared to the simulation results presented in the paper, **the average deviation between simulation and actual silicon verification results is less than 2%.**
